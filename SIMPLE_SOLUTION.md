# 🎵 Super Simple Romantic Website Solution 🎵

## What's happening:
The workflow is looking for server files that no longer exist, which is why you're seeing the error.

## Easiest solution:
Just open the `khayaal.html` file directly in your browser!

1. Download this file to your computer
2. Double-click to open in your browser
3. Share with your special someone

## That's it! No server needed

The `khayaal.html` file contains everything:
- The complete HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- All lyrics and animations
- The code to play the music

## To use a server anyway:

If you want to deploy to a website:
1. Copy both `khayaal.html` and `client/khayaal.mp3` to a folder
2. Upload that folder to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc)

Enjoy your romantic website! 💕
